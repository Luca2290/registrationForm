        My name is Țînă Luca Sebastian, I'm 17 and I live in Romania, Sanduleni.
        I study at Mihai Eminescu College, in Bacau and I am in my 3rd year of
        highschool. I have many passions but the main ones are going to the gym,
        football and of course, programming, which I've started to learn at the
        start of this year. I decided to begin with HTML and CSS and now I study
        JavaScript.I'm planning to become a web developer by learning this 3
        technologies and then React, TailWind,TypeScript and Next.JS.
